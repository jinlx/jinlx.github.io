Biomass burning (BB) impacts on the atmospheric burden of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is highly uncertain. Here we conduct the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) nested grid simulations to constrain BB emissions in the western US at ~25 km resolution. Across 3 widely used BB emission inventories (GFAS, GFED4, and QFED), the total BB VOC emission amountestimates from 14 species in the western US agree within 30â€“40% while individual VOC estimates can differ by up to a factor of 5, driven by the discrepancy of the regionally averaged emission ratios among inventories. Compared to recent WE-CAN and FIREX-AQ airborne observations, GEOS-Chem simulations driven by different BB emissionsGFAS, GFED4, and QFED all underpredict observed CO and VOC vertical profiles by a factor of at 3-5 when compared to recent WE-CAN and FIREX-AQ airborne observations, but. the model shows no to small biases for most species in low/no smoke conditions. We thus attribute the negative model biases to underestimated BB emissions in these inventories. Tripling BB emissions in the model reproduces observed primary compounds, but shows no or less significant improvements for Ooxygenated VOCs particularly formaldehyde, formic acid, and acetic acid, suggesting the model missesing secondary sources of these compounds in BB impacted environments.
