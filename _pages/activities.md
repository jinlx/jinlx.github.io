Here you can find a glimpse of my life beyond science.

I’m an INTJ-A (at least according to the test)—I love thinking in systems, planning ahead, and turning messy ideas into something clean, structured, and actually doable. Outside of research, I try to keep a steady routine: running, hiking, and gym training (a mix of cardio and strength). I also enjoy cooking, aka slowly upgrading from “it’s edible” to “wait… this is actually good.”

I’m also into personal finance and markets, especially the strategy side—risk control, frameworks, and long-term positioning. In practice, though, I’m still in the “tuition phase,” and I’ve definitely paid the market a few learning fees along the way. On the more personal and creative side, I’m a big music person—R&B, jazz, and gospel are my go-to genres, whether I’m working, relaxing, or just trying to reset my brain.
