to my website! I'm currently Ph.D. student in the Atmospheric Chemistry Observations and Modeling Group at the Unversity of Montana studying the atmospheric chemistry of VOCs by modelling with [Prof. Lu Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7WP7T3QAAAAJ&hl=en). My research aims to develop a fire-adapted global chemical transport model (CTM) based on [the GEOS-Chem CTM](https://geos-chem.seas.harvard.edu/#:~:text=GEOS%2DChem%20is%20a%20global,range%20of%20atmospheric%20composition%20problems). Here you can learn more [about me](link needed) beyond science, read about [my research](https://jinlx.github.io/research/), check my [peer-reviewed publications](web needed), my previous [talks or posters](web needed), and [things I studied for fun](web). Please don't hesitate to contact me if there are anything you are interested in. 

Prior to joining the UM, I received my B.S. in Atmospheric Science from Lanzhou University in China. The interest in air quality modelling took me to Seattle, the University of Washington for one semester, where I studied atmospheric chemistry and F0AM ([The Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling](https://sites.google.com/site/wolfegm/models)). Beyond research, my interests include hiking, travel, workout, cool things in industries.
