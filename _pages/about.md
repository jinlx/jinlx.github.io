to my website! I’m a postdoctoral researcher at Rutgers University in [Dr. Xiaomeng Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RoWh6MEAAAAJ)’s group, where I integrate satellite, aircraft, and surface observations with atmospheric models to quantify wildfire-smoke impacts on air quality and public health. I earned my Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Montana, working with [Dr. Lu Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7WP7T3QAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Bob Yokelson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aHNl6RwAAAAJ&hl=en) on wildfire emissions and the atmospheric chemistry of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using observation-constrained modeling. I received my B.S. in Atmospheric Science (Honors, top 10%) from Lanzhou University in China and previously spent a semester at the University of Washington with Dr. [Dan Jaffe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iDUkPfAAAAAJ&hl=en) focusing on 0-D modeling with F0AM.

My research focuses on improving our understanding of wildfire smoke chemistry and its impacts on air quality and public health. A core component of my work is developing fire-adapted chemical mechanisms and improving chemical transport model (CTM) representations based on [the GEOS-Chem CTM](https://geoschem.github.io/index.html). I combine 0-D box modeling (e.g., [F0AM](https://sites.google.com/site/wolfegm/models)) with field observations to diagnose key chemical processes and develop fire-adapted chemical mechanisms, reducing biases in simulated ozone and other secondary pollutants and strengthening exposure metrics for public-health applications.

**Key research questions I aim to address include:**
- How can wildfire emissions and atmospheric chemistry be better represented in CTMs to reduce biases in simulated air quality?
- How does smoke composition evolve from fresh plumes to multi-day aged pollution, and which processes control oxidant formation and secondary pollutants?
- What roles do reactive VOC classes (e.g., furanoids and other oxygenated species) play in ozone formation and secondary pollution in smoke-impacted regions?
- How can chemically resolved wildfire smoke exposure metrics improve population-scale health assessments beyond PM₂.₅ mass alone?
