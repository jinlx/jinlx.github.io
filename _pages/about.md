to my website! I recently graduated with a Ph.D. from the Atmospheric Chemistry Observations and Modeling Group at the University of Montana, where I studied wildfire emissions and the atmospheric chemistry of VOCs through observational constraints and modeling with [Prof. Lu Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7WP7T3QAAAAJ&hl=en). I am now a postdoctoral researcher in [Prof. Xiaomeng Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RoWh6MEAAAAJ)’s group at Rutgers University.

My research focuses on improving our understanding of wildfire smoke chemistry and its impacts on air quality and public health. A core component of my work is developing fire-adapted chemical mechanisms and improving chemical transport model (CTM) representations based on [the GEOS-Chem CTM](https://geoschem.github.io/index.html). I combine 0-D box modeling (e.g., [F0AM](https://sites.google.com/site/wolfegm/models)) with field observations to diagnose key chemical processes and develop fire-adapted chemical mechanisms, reducing biases in simulated ozone and other secondary pollutants and strengthening exposure metrics for public-health applications.

My research aims to improve representation of wildfire smoke chemistry in chemical transport models (CTMs), with a focus on GEOS-Chem. I combine 0-D box modeling (e.g., F0AM) with field observations to diagnose key chemical processes and develop fire-adapted chemical mechanisms, reducing biases in simulated ozone and other secondary pollutants and strengthening exposure metrics for public-health applications.

**Key research questions I aim to address include:**
- How can wildfire emissions and atmospheric chemistry be better represented in CTMs to reduce biases in simulated air quality?
- How does smoke composition evolve from fresh plumes to multi-day aged pollution, and which processes control oxidant formation and secondary pollutants?
- What roles do reactive VOC classes (e.g., furanoids and other oxygenated species) play in ozone formation and secondary pollution in smoke-impacted regions?
- How can chemically resolved wildfire smoke exposure metrics improve population-scale health assessments beyond PM₂.₅ mass alone?

Prior to joining the University of Montana, I received my B.S. in Atmospheric Science with Honors (top 10%) from Lanzhou University in China. My interest in air quality modeling took me to Seattle—the University of Washington for one semester—where I studied atmospheric chemistry and F0AM ([The Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling](https://sites.google.com/site/wolfegm/models)) with [Prof. Dan Jaffe](https://blogs.uw.edu/djaffe/pi-dan-jaffe/). Beyond research, my interests include hiking, travel, cooking, working out, and learning cool things in industry.
