to my website! I'm currently Ph.D. candidate in the Atmospheric Chemistry Observations and Modeling Group at the Unversity of Montana studying the atmospheric chemistry of VOCs by modelling with [Prof. Lu Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7WP7T3QAAAAJ&hl=en). My research aims to develop a fire-adapted global chemical transport model (CTM) based on [the GEOS-Chem CTM](https://geos-chem.seas.harvard.edu/#:~:text=GEOS%2DChem%20is%20a%20global,range%20of%20atmospheric%20composition%20problems). Here you can read [my CV](https://jinlx.github.io/files/CV_Lixu.pdf), check about [my research](https://jinlx.github.io/researches/), wade through my [peer-reviewed publications](https://jinlx.github.io/publications/), my previous [talks or posters](https://jinlx.github.io/presentations/), and my [interests beyond science](https://jinlx.github.io/activities/). Please don't hesitate to contact me if there is anything you want to discuss. 

Prior to joining the UM, I received my B.S. in Atmospheric Science with Honors (top 10%) from Lanzhou University in China. The interest in air quality modelling took me to Seattle, the University of Washington for one semester, where I studied atmospheric chemistry and F0AM ([The Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling](https://sites.google.com/site/wolfegm/models)) with [Prof. Dan Jaffe](https://blogs.uw.edu/djaffe/pi-dan-jaffe/). Beyond research, my interests include hiking, travel, cooking, workout, cool things in industries. You can learn more about those [activities](https://jinlx.github.io/publications/) here.
