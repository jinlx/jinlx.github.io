Welcome!
======
to my website! I'm currently Ph.D. student in the Atmospheric Chemistry Observations and Modeling Group at the Unversity of Montana studying the atmospheric chemistry of VOCs by modelling. Here you can learn more [about me] (link needed), read about [my research] (link needed), check my [peer-reviewed publications] (web needed), my previous [talks or posters] (web needed). Please don't hesitate to contact me if there are anything you are interested in. 

About Me
======
I am a PhD student at the UM, where I work with Prof. Lu Hu. My research aims to develop a fire-adapted global chemical transport model (CTM) based on [the GEOS-Chem CTM] (web needed). You can learn more about [my research] (link needed) here. Prior to joining the UM, I received my B.S. in Atmospheric Science from Lanzhou University in China. The interest in air quality modelling took me Seattle, the University of Washington for one semester, where I studied atmospheric chemistry and  F0AM ([The Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling] (link needed)). Beyond research, my interests include hiking, travel, and workout.
