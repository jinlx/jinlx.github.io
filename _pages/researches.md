## Overall
I will be taking the lead in developing a fire-adapted GEOS-Chem by improving the understanding of VOCs in emissions, chemical mechanisms, and plume dynamics in the model. This will help define the priority needs for further research to assess additional uncharacterized VOCs from fires and study fire impacts on human health. Two aircraft campaigns (i.e., WE-CAN and FIREX-AQ) and more than hundreds of ground measurements will span over the remainder of my PhD and provide vertical profile information and provide widespread regional surface information for data analysis.

## Biomass Burning Emission
I will provide GEOS-Chem simulations for collaborators to connect field data. In the biomass burning (BB) emission projection, we found that the wildland fire emissions are significantly underestimated in three commonly used fire inventories in the western US, likely driven by the low bias of dry matter burned in models. Scalling up the fire emissiosn resolve the low bias of primary compounds (CO and primary VOCs) in fires but not for OVOCs, reflecting that the OVOCs production is missing in the model.

## Biomass Burning Chemistry
As the priority of this stage, I will work on exploring the missing OVOCs source and answering what uncharacterized VOCs are needed to include in the model based on the WE-CAN campaign. Specific focus will be on furan and its 4 derivatives (those VOCs containing 4-carbon and 1-oxygen aromatic ring). The GEOS-Chem mechanism will be evaluated along with the most explicit chemical mechanism of trace gas. The chemical impacts from fire smoke will be investigated from regional and global schale. 

## Biomass Burning Transport and heath concerns
Post deployment I will work to evaluate current 5 available injections parametrizations on plume transport and plume evolution and provide recomm. Finally, I will use our fire-adapted GEOS-Chem to provide the fire impacts on human health from regional to global scale.
