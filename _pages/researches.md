## Overall
My research aims to improve how air-quality and chemical transport models (CTMs) represent wildfire smoke—from emissions to chemistry to human exposure. My Ph.D. work at the University of Montana focused on constraining wildfire volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, evaluating smoke chemistry using aircraft and ground observations, and translating multi-day aged smoke into community-level exposure and health-relevant metrics. As a postdoctoral researcher at Rutgers University, I am extending this work toward more chemically resolved exposure indicators and model–measurement frameworks that connect smoke composition to public-health outcomes.

A central theme across my projects is **building a fire-adapted modeling framework (primarily within GEOS-Chem)** that is strongly constrained by observations (aircraft campaigns, ground networks, targeted measurements, and satellite products where appropriate). The goal is to move beyond “PM₂.₅-only” wildfire smoke characterization and toward **mechanistic understanding and actionable metrics** that better reflect toxicity and oxidant formation.

**Key research questions I work on include:**
- How can wildfire emissions and smoke chemistry be represented more accurately in CTMs to reduce biases in simulated air quality?
- How does smoke composition evolve from fresh plumes to multi-day aged pollution, and which processes control oxidant formation and secondary pollutants?
- What roles do reactive VOC classes (e.g., furanoids and other oxygenated VOCs) play in ozone formation and secondary organic products in smoke-impacted regions?
- How can chemically resolved wildfire smoke metrics improve population-scale exposure and health assessments beyond PM₂.₅ mass alone?

## Wildfire Emissions
I constrain wildfire emissions of VOCs using aircraft and ground-based observations, with an emphasis on identifying why models can reproduce some primary tracers (e.g., CO) while underestimating important oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs). My work has shown that common fire inventories can **substantially underestimate wildfire emissions in the western U.S.**, and that scaling total fire emissions can reduce biases in primary species but does not fully resolve **OVOC underestimates**, highlighting the importance of chemistry (secondary production) and/or missing emitted precursors.

**What I do in this area:**
- Use aircraft campaign datasets (e.g., WE-CAN, FIREX-AQ) to constrain emission ratios and evaluate inventory biases.
- Diagnose whether model–observation gaps are driven by burned area / dry matter burned, emission factors, plume injection, or chemical processing.
- Provide model-ready emission constraints that improve predictive skill for smoke-impacted air quality.

## Smoke Chemistry and Mechanism Development
Wildfire smoke is chemically complex, and many reactive VOCs that matter for ozone (O₃) and OVOC formation are still simplified or missing in standard mechanisms. A major component of my research is **improving chemical mechanisms for wildfire VOCs** and quantifying how these improvements change oxidant budgets and secondary pollutant formation.

A specific focus of my work is **furanoids** (furan and substituted furans), which are abundant in biomass burning emissions and can be important precursors for oxygenated products and O₃ formation. I combine:
- **0-D (box) modeling** for mechanism evaluation and process attribution,
- **3-D CTM simulations** for regional-to-global impacts and realism,
- and **observational constraints** to ensure mechanism updates are supported by measurements.

**Example outputs include:**
- Mechanism evaluation against fresh-plume observations (e.g., O₃ photochemistry, radical chemistry, and VOC evolution).
- Sensitivity analyses that identify the reactions and VOC classes that most control modeled O₃ and OVOCs in smoke.

## Aged Smoke in Communities: Exposure and Health-Relevant Metrics
A core motivation of my dissertation was that **community-scale smoke measurements beyond PM₂.₅ are rare**, which limits both model evaluation and health interpretation. I therefore focus on multi-day aged smoke that impacts cities and quantify how smoke alters not only PM₂.₅ but also chemically specific hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and oxidant-related conditions.

Using the Missoula, Montana 2020 wildfire episode as a case study, I connect:
- ground observations (criteria pollutants + speciated VOCs where available),
- CTM simulations of smoke transport and chemistry,
- and exposure/risk-relevant indicators (e.g., cancer risk proxies and noncancer hazard metrics, when appropriate).

In my postdoctoral work, I am extending these ideas toward **chemically informed exposure metrics** that can be scaled across regions (e.g., integrating satellite-derived chemical context, meteorology, and mixture indicators alongside wildfire PM₂.₅).

## Smoke Transport and Model Evaluation (Ongoing / Future Directions)
Accurate prediction of smoke impacts also requires getting **transport and vertical injection** right. I am interested in evaluating how different plume injection and mixing assumptions affect:
- downwind PM₂.₅ and O₃,
- chemical aging timescales,
- and city-scale exposure estimates.

This includes intercomparisons of injection parameterizations and process-level diagnostics to identify the conditions under which model transport choices dominate uncertainty in surface impacts.
