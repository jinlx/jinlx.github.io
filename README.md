A quick tour for the design logics (just in case if anyone wants to rebuild the wheel):
1) ./_data/navigation: sector navigator (e.g., research, publication, and presentations)
2) ./_pages/about.md : welcome page for texts

There are several things to be Done:
1) get a nice and professional profile;
2) upload some figures of my personal activities (e.g., food, travelling, workout progress, and game).
