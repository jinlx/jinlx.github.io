A quick tour for the design logics (just in case if anyone wants to rebuild the wheel):
1) ./_data/navigation: sector navigator (e.g., research, publication, and presentations)
2) ./_pages/about.md : welcome page for texts

There are several things TBD (I can foresee this will be growing due to my procrastination):
1) get a nice and professional profile in _config.yml
2) upload some figures of my personal activities (e.g., food, travelling, workout progress, and game).
3) update some blog postin posts section and add the link in the homepage (https://jinlx.github.io/year-archive/). This would be a hidden website for posts.
4) For figures, here goes an example for how other people make live figure or video collection (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ehsong/ehsong.github.io/master/_pages/personal.md; https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/829)
